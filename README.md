# Overly-Complicated-Hello-World-Binary-Tree
An overly complicated "Hello World!" application using a Binary Search Tree

This program was created for fun to use excessive amounts of logic. It creates a binary search tree based off of ascii characters and indexes based on their ascii value. It then searches the tree for each ascii value of an input string and return the corresponding alphanumeric character to compose an output message.
